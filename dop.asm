; Creating a Turing-complete assembly language with data-oriented features would likely involve extending an existing assembly language with new instructions and constructs that support data-oriented programming concepts, such as data-parallelism, vectorization, and memory-efficient data layouts.

; For example, you might add instructions for working with large arrays of data, such as instructions for loading and storing data in bulk, as well as instructions for performing mathematical operations on entire arrays at once. Additionally, you would need to include constructs for controlling data-parallelism, such as support for parallel loops and thread-local memory.

; It is important to note that creating a new assembly language is a non-trivial task, and would require a lot of expertise in both assembly programming and data-oriented design. Moreover, the data-oriented concepts are not typically implemented in assembly language, as it's a low-level language and the data-oriented programming is usually implemented in the higher level languages that can be translated to the assembly code with the help of compilers.

; Here's an example of a simple assembly language program that demonstrates some basic data-oriented concepts:

; Define an array of integers
section .data
    arr: times 100 dd 0

; Define a function for initializing the array with random values
section .text
    global init_array
    init_array:
        ; Loop through the array, initializing each element with a random value
        mov ecx, 100
        mov esi, arr
        loop:
            ; Generate a random value and store it in the array
            call rand
            mov [esi], eax
            add esi, 4
            dec ecx
            jnz loop
        ret

; Define a function for adding all elements of the array
section .text
    global add_array
    add_array:
        ; Initialize the accumulator to zero
        xor eax, eax
        mov ecx, 100
        mov esi, arr
        loop:
            add eax, [esi]
            add esi, 4
            dec ecx
            jnz loop
        ret

; Define a function for displaying the result
section .text
    global display_result
    display_result:
        ; Print the result
        call print_int
        ret

; Main function
section .text
    global _start
    _start:
        ; Initialize the array
        call init_array

        ; Add all elements of the array
        call add_array

        ; Display the result
        call display_result

        ; Exit the program
        xor eax, eax
        mov ebx, eax
        int 0x80

; This is just a basic example, it is not a real language, this is not meant to be compiled or executed. The example demonstrates how data-oriented concepts like arrays, data-parallelism, and memory-efficient data layouts can be implemented using assembly language instructions. It is important to note that this example is not complete and it's not a working language, it's only a demonstration of how data-oriented concepts can be implemented using assembly language.

; The example uses some basic assembly instructions such as mov, call, and print_int to demonstrate the concept of working with arrays and data-parallelism. The example uses the concepts of data-parallelism by having a loop that iterates over the entire array and performs the same operation on each element.
