; Sure, here's a more complex example that demonstrates some advanced data-oriented concepts in assembly language:

; Define an array of floating-point numbers
section .data
    arr: times 100 dq 0.0

; Define a function for initializing the array with random values
section .text
    global init_array
    init_array:
        ; Loop through the array, initializing each element with a random value
        mov ecx, 100
        mov esi, arr
        fldz
        loop:
            ; Generate a random value and store it in the array
            call rand
            fild dword [esp]
            fmul qword [rand_max]
            fstp qword [esi]
            add esi, 8
            dec ecx
            jnz loop
        ret

; Define a function for adding all elements of the array
section .text
    global add_array
    add_array:
        ; Initialize the accumulator to zero
        xor eax, eax
        mov ecx, 100
        mov esi, arr
        fldz
        loop:
            fadd qword [esi]
            add esi, 8
            dec ecx
            jnz loop
        fstp qword [result]
        ret

; Define a function for displaying the result
section .text
    global display_result
    display_result:
        ; Print the result
        fld qword [result]
        call print_float
        ret

; Main function
section .text
    global _start
    _start:
        ; Initialize the array
        call init_array

        ; Add all elements of the array
        call add_array

        ; Display the result
        call display_result

        ; Exit the program
        xor eax, eax
        mov ebx, eax
        int 0x80

; This example demonstrates some advanced data-oriented concepts, such as working with floating-point numbers, use of mathematical operations on arrays and also the use of data-parallelism. It uses some advanced assembly instructions such as fld, fstp, fmul and fadd for working with floating-point numbers and the use of these instructions in a loop that iterates over the entire array to perform mathematical operations on each element of the array.

; It also uses the call instruction to invoke the rand function, a random number generator, which is used to initialize the array with random values. It also uses the print_float function to print the final result of adding all elements of the array.

; It's important to note that this example is not complete and it's not a working language, it's only a demonstration of how data-oriented concepts can be implemented using assembly language. Also, it's important to note that this example uses x86 assembly language, and it will not work on other architectures.

; In data-oriented programming, performance and memory efficiency are key concerns, so the data layout and memory access pattern are very important. The example uses the concept of data-parallelism to perform the same operation on each element of the array in parallel, this can be beneficial for performance in certain scenarios, especially when working with large arrays of data.
