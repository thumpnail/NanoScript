# NanoScript
 Nano Script is a Language Interpreter i am doing for learning purposes.
 It is visualy based on Assambler/Byte Code, so it contains OpCodes but with variable amount of "Parameter".
 My goal ist to create a language which you can mostly write without using any Specials(+,-,*,/,[,],{,},...) so it is easier to write.
 Performance it not a priority of this language at the moment.

 Language Definition is contained in [def.nano](./Nano/def.nano)
 Some fancy imaginary shit is contained in [test.nano](./Nano/Test.nano)
## Currently working Features
 + Variables(var)
 + Constants(let)
 + Arrays
 + Defining things(dk what for)
 + Lables and jmp(Jump) command
 + Calling builtIn functions(cll)
 + Funny Compiler Error Messages
 + Working functions with returns
 + Kinda working If (needs testing but seems stable)
 
## Dependencies(for debug only)
 + Newtonsoft.Json
 + BetterConsoleTables
