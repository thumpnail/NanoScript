# NanoScript
 Nano Script is a Language Interpreter i am doing for learning purposes.
 It is visualy based on Assambler/Byte Code, so it contains OpCodes but with variable amount of "Parameter".
 My goal ist to create a language which you can mostly write without using any specials like Specials(+,-,*,/,[,],{,},...) so it is easy to write.
 Performance it not a priority of this language at the moment.
