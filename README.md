# NanoScript
 Nano Script is a Language Interpreter i am doing for learning purposes.
 It is visualy based on Assambler/Byte Code, so it contains OpCodes but with variable amount of "Parameter".
 My goal ist to create a language which you can mostly write without using any Specials(+,-,*,/,[,],{,},...) so it is easier to write.
 Performance it not a priority of this language at the moment.

 Language Definition is contained in [def.nano](./NanoScript/Nano Operational Functional Script/def.nano)
